The opt-in is only rejected when the session can never track (a subagent session, or one without local session storage). It is intentionally absent from the mutable options update because enabling it after edits have occurred would create an incomplete, misleading baseline. Subagents share the parent session's capture store and are not tracked as separate rewind points: a file a subagent writes is attributed to whichever root user turn was open when the capture was staged, just before the tool body ran. A turn cannot open while a staged capture is still in flight, so a subagent tool that staged under the spawning turn stays attributed to it however late the write lands, while a capture it stages after the user's next message belongs to that later turn. Attribution decides which turn's rewind point counts and file preview include that write; it does not narrow which rewinds revert it, because a rewind restores every capture from the selected turn onward, so the earlier spawning turn reverts it as well.

For cold hydration, await the first successful page before activation and establish lossless live-event buffering before resume; merge subsequent live events by ID, preserving persisted order and letting live payloads win. Continuations are process-local, single-use capabilities bound to the originating session and storage context and must be paged sequentially; concurrent or repeated use of the same cursor expires that duplicate read rather than reading the generation twice.

No transcript copy is created, but retained handles may keep replaced files' disk blocks alive until release. Pages have a soft 1 MiB serialized event-array budget including resolved binary assets; one oversized event is returned alone to guarantee progress. Working memory also includes a record/lookahead and asset resolution; resolving the first binary reference may scan the full pinned generation to build a bounded offset index. If the snapshot expires, is evicted, is cancelled before a continuation is established, or becomes unreadable after an observable unsupported in-place shortening, the continuation returns cursorStatus 'expired' with an empty terminal page and never falls back to a different generation.
